# Eres - Healthcare Management and Appointment Platform

**Eres** is a healthcare management platform designed to facilitate appointment bookings and consultations seamlessly. The app allows users to manage appointments, access consultation records, and interact with healthcare providers, all while ensuring a smooth experience using blockchain technology for secure transactions and interactions.

This project was built as part of the *Hack This Fall* hackathon.

## Demo Video
A demo video showcasing the features and functionality of the Eres platform can be viewed [here on Devfolio](#link-to-devfolio-video).

---

## Features
- **Healthcare Management:** Keep track of appointments, consultations, and patient records.
- **Appointment Booking:** Users can easily book appointments with healthcare providers.
- **Consultation:** Secure video or chat consultation with doctors and healthcare professionals.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ethereum integration for secure interactions and transactions.
- **Privacy:** It ensures privacy of the details of every patient and patient can have compelete reliablility on this system
---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18.17.1 or 18.17.2 for compatibility with Hardhat).
- **NVM** (Node Version Manager) for switching Node versions easily.
- **Metamask Chrome Extension** for Ethereum wallet integration with the app.
- **Hardhat** for Ethereum development and smart contract testing.

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. **Install Dependencies**

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thebinary110/eres.git
cd eres
```

Install the necessary packages using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 2. **Set Node.js Version**

Ensure that your Node.js version is compatible with Hardhat. If your Node.js version is higher than v18.17.2, you will need to use **nvm** (Node Version Manager) to switch to version **v18.17.1** or **v18.17.2**.

1. Install **nvm** (if not already installed):
   - For Mac/Linux:
     ```bash
     curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
     ```
   - For Windows, use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

2. Install the required Node.js version:
   ```bash
   nvm install 18.17.1
   ```

3. Set the version to **v18.17.1**:
   ```bash
   nvm use 18.17.1
   ```

---

### 3. **Run Hardhat Node**

Hardhat is used to simulate an Ethereum blockchain network on your local machine.

1. Start the Hardhat local Ethereum node:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

This will start a local Ethereum node, and you should see something like this in the terminal:

```bash
Hardhat local network started on http://localhost:8545
```

---

### 4. **Configure Hardhat for Ethereum (Localhost)**

To configure your Ethereum network on **Metamask**, follow these steps:

1. Open **Metamask** in your Chrome browser.

2. After configuring the network, import the accounts generated by Hardhat into Metamask:
   - You will see private keys in the terminal when you start the Hardhat node. Use those private keys to import accounts into Metamask.

---

### 5. **Update Image Paths**

Ensure that the image paths in the project correspond to your system's file structure. Update the paths in the relevant files to point to the correct locations on your local machine.

For example, if your images are located in a directory called `public/`, you may need to update the image paths in your code:


const imagePath = "/public/images/your-image.jpg";
```

Adjust the path according to your project's file structure.

---

### 6. **Run the App Locally**

To run the app on your local machine, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
